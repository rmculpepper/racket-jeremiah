# Jeremiah was a Frog

This is a static blog generator that evolved out of a heavily modified
version of [Frog](https://github.com/greghendershott/frog) by @greghendershott.

During this evolution, the code lost several of the virtues of the
original, such as tests and documentation. It's not finished. It's not
compatible with Frog. It's not stable. ~~At the time of this writing, I
haven't even implemented the command-line interface yet.~~
